If you want to know more about digital accessibility and how it can best be applied in practice. Then you can visit the Accessibility website (Dutch). In addition to information, we also offer training and e-learning modules in both Dutch and English to help you further make your site accessible. Accessibility can also help you through consultancy, audits or user research.
