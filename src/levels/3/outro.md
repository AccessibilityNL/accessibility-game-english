As you have noticed, it is not easy to navigate through a page without seeing it.

In the first page there were 4 images without "Alt Text", without text alternatives a blind person cannot answer this question.

In the second page the input fields were poorly labeled, making it more difficult to figure out where to write your info. Because the buttons also have no label, you do not know what the buttons do before they are activated. 

## Tips

* Use Alt texts as an alternative to images
* Label your buttons with clear text (texts like "Read more" or "Click here" are often not clear)
