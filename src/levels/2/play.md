You must have noticed that many colours looked very similar. Colourblind people often run into this because they cannot properly see the difference between colours. This can be solved by using coulors that have a greater contrast with each other, but also by adding an icon or other visual feature to help distinguish what belongs together and what not.

You are now going to play the same game with a set of icons on the pictures.
