When designing for people with dyslexia, it is important to keep the text as simple as possible and to use a clear structure. This also makes the text more pleasant to read for everyone. 

## Tips

* Add images or diagrams to support the text
* Avoid long blocks of text and ensure a simple, clear structure
* Offer alternatives in the form of videos or narration
