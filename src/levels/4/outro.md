People with ADHD are easily distracted. Busy website designs and overflowing navigation options could be seen as very annoying.

These improvements are not only pleasant for people with ADHD; regular users also benefit from this.

## Tips

* Avoid complex menus and ensure a linear, logical design
* Avoid distracting images and videos next to the page content
* Avoid time limits, make sure everyone has enough time to fill in everything calmly
