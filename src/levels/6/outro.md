When designing for people with tunnel vision, it is important to ensure that elements are not too far apart. Also make sure that elements are not temporarily on the screen, it takes longer for someone with tunnel vision to "scan" a page.


* Make sure that associated elements are close to each other
* Put elements in a predictable place, for example the logo at the top left and navigation at the top right of the page
* Provide sufficient contrast between text and background and between different sections of the page
