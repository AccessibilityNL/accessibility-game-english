Hearing with an auditory disability is limited. Some people with hearing impairment can hear sound, but they don't always hear enough to understand speech. Especially when there is (a lot of) background noise, this can cause problems.

Tools like closed captioning can also be useful for people with normal hearing, such as when you're on a busy train and can't hear your phone's speaker.

* Always ensure correct subtitles or transcription for video or audio
* Make sure that video / audio players have functions to pause and to turn the volume up or down
